# YOLOv8 Model Definition

I needed to use the YOLOv8 model architecture for running some benchmark experiments on some other repositories. However, the structure of the original YOLOv8 repository by Ultralytics (https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) made it difficult to easily pull the model definition out. Therefore, I thought I would just share the model definition module here.
